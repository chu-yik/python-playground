--- Contech Lab ---

General Background
- with friends and 3rd party share holder (RFID company with various mobile projects)
- work on R&D of BLE (2013 when bluetooth 4.0 application is emerging, Apple iBeacon)
    - Beacon Fish shopper experience
    - POC for carpark in Science Park
    - Phase 3 project for "exhibition", GPS + iBeacon proximity
    - HaiDiLao hotpot shop
- work as contractor for outsourced mobile projects
    - VCity
    - Kakamega (story telling app)

> Indoor position system [Think big]
S: early 2013, BLE / Bluetooth 4.0 Core Spec Addendum 4, low power, low cost chips powered by coin cell battery
T: brainstorming products for our start-up as a product to sell
A: bought prototypes off china online store (As cheap as 5 HKD < 1 USD), place in office and use triangluartion alogorithm to do "coarse" indoor GPS
R: 
    - RSSI signal strength is not reliable, only good for proximity (very close, near by, far away)
    - noticably constructive / destructive interferrence, was good learning 
    - not really good for small space such as office
    - good learning, low cost (only time spent)
    - experience for some future projects

> Haidilao indoor POC [Earn trust, deliver results]
S: 
    - shareholder's friend working for HaiDiLao, big hot pot franchise in China, using some high-tech stuff
    - provide tablet for ordering, want to explore possibility for "in-store navigation" so to save workload of staff
T: 
    - create POC with shop map and on-site demonstration
A:
    - I pointed out it is not good for in-store navigation (experience with our trial in office)
    - shareholder insisted we try anyway
    - figure it might be a good way to meet new connectiong so did it anyway
R:
    - did a free POC for HaiDiLao and there is no follow-up
    - learnt that metallic objects like utensil would further interfere with RSSI reading
    - spent time and travelling expense

> Science Park green path - proximity system [Earn trust, biased for action]
S: 
    - did some POC for science park introducting our capability to do "indoor proximity check"
    - car park POC to "find my car" didn't work out
    - Science park has a new phase opening up and will host an short-term exhibition "renewable energy"
    - want to create a "tour guide" app to introduce the exhibited items like design features and what not
    - asked us to create the app and include proximity checking
T:
    - standalone app for green trail
    - hardware for the beacons to use as identifiers for points of interest
A:
    - created the app
    - used multiple coin cell battery powered in case the beacons run out of power
    - built back-end API for matching UUID with the POIs
R:
    - good that the POIs are far enough away from each other
    - good enough for the exhibition
    - apps taken down after exhibition completed
    - would have used better solution if it is longer term

> Beacon Fish - proximity shopping experience [Earn trust, Think big]
S: 
    - create shopper experience using proximity solution
    - shareholder's friend has a shop in Shanghai, willing to let us film as a POC
T:
    - create business solution as product and find potential users
A:
    - created (3D printed) housing for beacon fish (same chipset)
    - created video and demo app for solution package
    - divide sections of the shop front and know where customers are at
    - shopper "check-in" as a loyalty program
R:
    - not easy to find adoption
    - big franchises are hard to infiltrate due to lack of connection and track record
    - small franchies are skeptical about the solution and were not willing to adopt

> Kakamega child book app -> platform for content creator [Earn trust, Think big]
S:
    - client is composer and want to create app for her story
    - own voice acting and art resources
T:
    - create this "musical" app with the resources given
A:
    - using cocos-2d-x to create parser for XML file "script"
    - enabled us to quickly script out the scenes with animation sequence
    - discussed the possibility of launch the "engine: as an extra product
R:
    - created app for the client in short period of time
    - no further request before we end our little start up
    - but personally resuability is indeed a good idea

--- Accedo.tv ---

General Background
- Stockholm based video solution company
- team in HK mostly deal with projects for tailoring solutions for clients
- also "core" team for the mobile SDK
- was in the "core" team
- offered relocation to Stockholm as "core" team is being relocated
- had an offer from Sphero so did not take offer

--- Sphero ---

General Background
- Sphero is a US based, smart toy company, in Boulder, Colorado
- Some well-known products - BB8, R2-D2, Lightning McQueen
- Some less well-known ones are Sphero, Ollie, SPRK
- Most products were manufactured in China, a factory in GuangDong called Jetta
- Hong Kong team was initially set up to support manufacturing
- Later the team also do product prototyping and sourcing for new manufacturers
- I was the only software engineer in Hong Kong
- First supporting a collaboration project with Tencent for their version of the Sphero robot
- Then work on maintaining the Test Fixture Softwares
- And also help with any other tasks that involve softwares 
    - app for controlling prototypes
    - build databases and query API
    - fixing printers and coffee machines (kidding)


> Tencent Project

> Testing Data - [learn + curious]

S: Logs are syncrhonized with good sync from factory computer, problems are unreliable network and bad configurations
T: Creating database and query app for internal testing data
A: learnt node.js, mongo db, set up cron job and write scripts for process data, before I can start to work on the mobile app to query data
R: a better backend that the US team was able to fetch data and answer questions regarding manufacturing

> Improve TF software - feed back from Jetta [customer obsession]

S: need to fix / maintain TF software

--- HK01 ---

General Background
- 

> general ownership [ownership]

S: hk01 mobile app, different teams working on it, react native with a ton of dependencies, and many forked version of dependencies which leads to messy codebase
T: as core team, we are to work on features that is not specific team’s task, or other teams will hook up to use, for example, notification centre, deferred deep link
A: refactor existing codebase, added danger.js to check for new dependencies, talk to teams that want to add that and understand why they want to do so, and if there are alternatives
also start working on adding unit tests, flow, patch-package instead of forking dependencies
R: continually improving test coverage and make our lives a little bit easier day by day

> refactor, automation, unit testing [ownership]

> PR review [develop the best, high standard, earn trust]

> upgrade RN blocker - multiple solution [bias for action, frugality]

S: upgrading RN, find stale dependencies that are no longer maintained and blocks RN upgrade
T: either we keep a own copy, or write our own dependencies, or fork and keep a copy
A: try to find solutions and came across patch-package, as a temp solution before ticketing team has time to handle those dependencies
R: patch-package works and helps on other dependencies fixing or fine tuning as well
more:  might want to think about alternatives, or removing the dependencies all together as those are really simple packages and we probably were just lazy and didn’t build our own (might not have need to do so

> geolocation permission [right a lot, backbone, bias for action]
S: we have wrapper to bridge events from web to app, one of them being get location, app used to prompt for location permission but that need to change as we are going to allow 3rd party web to get location from app
T: think about proper approach for doing so
A: suggested to have location permission asked at app start up but go rejected, as UX is not ready for on boarding, alternatively suggest to create new event for getting location permission but after discussion agreed to use the same web view event coz existing implementation of the web will not need to change
R: it is kind of a tech debt but i did what can be done at the time
